# E-Commerce Order Management System

## Overview

This Java-based E-Commerce Order Management System demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling. It allows users to create orders, manage product stock, and handle out-of-stock scenarios.

### Technologies Used

* Java

* Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap)

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Exception Handling
#### How to Run

* Compile and run ECommerceSystem.java.

* Orders are created programmatically in the main method.

* If an order exceeds available stock, an OutOfStockException is thrown.

* The program outputs total order costs and user order history.

#### Example Output
Total Order Cost for Order 101: $1040.0
Error: Not enough stock for product: T-Shirt
User 1 Order History: 1 orders

##### Future Enhancements

* Implement a user interface (CLI or GUI)
